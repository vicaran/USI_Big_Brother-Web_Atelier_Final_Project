The Pizza Customer is hungry for pizza, so first he selects a pizza, and then makes an order. The pizza order is received by the clerk at the Pizza Vendor. The clerk informs the pizza chef which starts baking the pizza, while the customer waits for it. If the pizza doesnâ€™t arrive in 60 minutes, the customer calls the Pizza Vendor, and the clerk will calm him, assuring the pizza is going to be delivered soon. Eventually, the pizza chef is done baking the pizza, and the delivery boy delivers it to the customer. The customer receives the pizza and pays for it, the delivery boy receives the payment and emits a receipt. Finally the customer eats the pizza and satisfies his hunger. When the payment is received, the process ends.
