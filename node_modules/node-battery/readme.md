Node.js Battery Module
===============================
This module provides information on **linux and osx** about the power sources.

Usage
------------------------
Node-battery provides two methods:
````JavaScript
var nodeBattery = require("node-battery");

nodeBattery.getBatteries(function(data){

	// Linux only
	// "data" Is an array containing paths to the battery files
});

nodeBattery.percentages(function(data){

	// "data" Is an array containing a percentage of power left for each battery.
});

nodeBattery.isCharging(function(data){

	// "data" Is an array containing a 0 or a 1 depending on wheter the battery is being charged.
});
````
On Linux this module works by reading out the BAT* files in '/sys/class/power_supply'.

If no batteries are detected this could be caused by the fact that your BAT* files start with BAT0 instead of BAT1,
to fix this just pass in a 0 as the second argument.
